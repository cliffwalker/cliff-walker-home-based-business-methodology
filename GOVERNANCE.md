This document defines the governance principles, ethical standards, and usage boundaries for the **Cliff Walker Home-Based Business Methodology**.

It exists to protect the integrity of the methodology, ensure responsible use, and provide clarity around accountability, version control, and acceptable application.

## Purpose of Governance

The governance framework exists to:

- Preserve the integrity and intent of the methodology  
- Prevent misuse, misrepresentation, or misleading claims  
- Ensure ethical and responsible application  
- Support long-term consistency and version control  
- Enable structured evolution of the framework over time  

This methodology is designed as an educational and operational framework, not as a guarantee of outcomes.

## Core Governance Principles

### 1. Ethical Practice
All use of this methodology must align with ethical, lawful, and transparent business conduct.

This includes:
- Honest communication  
- No deceptive or manipulative practices  
- No exaggerated or misleading claims  
- Respect for individuals and communities  

---

### 2. No Income or Outcome Guarantees
This methodology does **not** promise or imply:

Results depend on individual effort, skill, context, consistency, and execution.

Any representation suggesting guaranteed or typical outcomes is not permitted.

### 3. Responsible Use of AI

Where AI tools are referenced or used in connection with this methodology, they must be applied responsibly.

Principles include:

- AI is a support tool, not a decision-maker  
- Human judgment and accountability remain central  
- Outputs should be reviewed before use  
- AI must not be used to mislead, impersonate, or deceive  
- Privacy and data protection must be respected at all times  

AI is intended to enhance clarity, efficiency, and learning — not replace ethical responsibility.
