# Governance-Led Entrepreneurship (Definition and Standards)

## Definition
Governance-led entrepreneurship is building an enterprise with explicit standards that protect:
- customers (truthfulness, clarity, consent),
- the operator (sustainability, financial realism),
- the business (repeatability, compliance hygiene, learning loops).

## Non-Negotiables
1) Truthfulness discipline (no fabricated outcomes or implied guarantees)
2) System discipline (repeatable acquisition + follow-up)
3) Financial discipline (test before scaling)
4) Ethical and compliance boundaries (consent, privacy, platform compliance)
5) Learning loops (weekly review and iteration)
